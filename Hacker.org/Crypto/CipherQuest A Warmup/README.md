# CipherQuest A Warmup

诶，quipqiup虽然不能一次性解出答案，但是有很大的帮助。

我大概解出了这么个状态：

> to dayS myS boysriendS told SmeSheS couldnt ShanLS outS with SmeS becaupe SheS seltS really Spick.S iS wentS to Ship ShoupeS any wayS to Spur gripeS himS with S homemadeS poug.S iS walkS in S to ShipS roomS only StoS sindS him Shook in LSu g S with SmyS pip ter. Sp he ScantS drive.S ourS momS droveS herS there.S sm l

可以看出来前几个词语大概是today my boyfriends told me he couldn't hang out with me because he felt really sick.

似乎已经达到了题目要求。不过我们试试看解出全文。手动写了个脚本。查了一个词的翻译。

hook up

1. recieved a good or service as a favor 
2. to make out with someone 
3. to have sex with someone

似乎是个很有趣的小故事？手动斜眼。
