# Didactic Bytes

Let us take the following three decimal numbers:

199, 77, 202

Convert each one into a byte. (Even though 77 does not require all 8 bits to express itself, when dealing with a group of data, we usually keep it in a consistent form.) Now, take those three bytes and combine them to form a 24-bit unsigned integer. The 199 byte is the high byte (most significant) and so forth. Please enter that 24-bit integer in decimal form, and that is your answer. (Hint: your answer will not be '19977202'!)
